        <p>HoopWithSean is a transformative platform dedicated to empowering disadvantaged communities through the art of basketball. Rooted in my own journey, it offers a beacon of hope and guidance. Drawing from personal experiences, I provide tailored advice and insights to inspire individuals to embrace basketball not just as a sport, but as a pathway to personal growth and community engagement. With a focus on inclusivity and mentorship, HoopWithSean fosters resilience, teamwork, and self-belief. Together, we break barriers, defy odds, and forge a brighter future. Join us on the court, where every hoop is a step towards empowerment and every dribble, a testament to potential.

Focus on a smooth looking textbook-kinda shooting form first, then start using it to shoot every day from close to the rim to free throw then to 3 pointers. One thing I always like saying is that "If you have to push your arms to shoot, you are not shooting, you are throwing so take one step closer and retry".</p>
